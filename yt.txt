So what's going on? I'm a talking dog. The other issue. Oh, I'm scratching like crazy. You've got some allergic. Itch with skin inflammation. Apple can work on that in as little as 4 hours, whether it's a new or chronic problem. And Apple treated over were 7 million dogs. Nice. And the talking dog thing, is it bothering you? No, it seemed like a dog is bothering me until dogs can speak for themselves. You have to. When allergic gets a problem, ask for Apiquille. Apiquil is for the control of it associated with allergic dermatitis and the control of atopic dermatitis in dogs. Do not use Apiqual in dogs less than twelve months old or those with serious infections. Apiquil may increase the chance of developing serious infections and may cause existing parasitic skin infestations or preexisting cancers to worsen. Do not use in breeding pregnant or lactating dogs. Most common side effects are vomiting and diarrhea. I'm speechless. Thanks for the Abiquil. That's what friends are for. Ask your veterinarian for Abiquil. Next to you. Abiquil is a dog's best friend.
