1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,446
So what's going on? I'm a talking dog. The other issue.

2
00:00:04,568 --> 00:00:08,098
Oh, I'm scratching like crazy. You've got some allergic.

3
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:11,394
Itch with skin inflammation. Apple can work on that in as little as

4
00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:14,982
4 hours, whether it's a new or chronic problem. And Apple treated over

5
00:00:14,996 --> 00:00:18,702
were 7 million dogs. Nice. And the talking dog thing, is it

6
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:22,062
bothering you? No, it seemed like a dog is bothering me

7
00:00:22,136 --> 00:00:25,342
until dogs can speak for themselves. You have to. When allergic

8
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:29,518
gets a problem, ask for Apiquille. Apiquil is for the control of it associated

9
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:32,902
with allergic dermatitis and the control of atopic dermatitis in dogs.

10
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:36,190
Do not use Apiqual in dogs less than twelve months old or those with serious

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,338
infections. Apiquil may increase the chance of developing serious infections and

12
00:00:40,364 --> 00:00:44,206
may cause existing parasitic skin infestations or preexisting cancers to worsen.

13
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:47,842
Do not use in breeding pregnant or lactating dogs. Most common side effects

14
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:51,238
are vomiting and diarrhea. I'm speechless.

15
00:00:51,394 --> 00:00:54,966
Thanks for the Abiquil. That's what friends are for.

16
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:59,022
Ask your veterinarian for Abiquil. Next to you. Abiquil is

17
00:00:59,036 --> 00:00:59,700
a dog's best friend.
